When working on a big project, you will not be able to work on the original repository. You CAN fork(clone) a copy to your own computer. You can make the changes or new code to your forked version. When you are done with your changes, you will have to do a "pull" from the original repository.
To do this,
git pull upstream "name of the original repository".
Then finish your code. turn into the powers that be.
