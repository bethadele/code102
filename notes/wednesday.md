function sayMyName () {
    consolelog('Hi, Beth');
}

sayMyName ();

    //This calls the function, but does not execute the function.

var sayMyClass = function() {
    console.log('Code 102');
};
sayMyClass();

    //That expression calls the function.

sayMyClass

//Calls the function


Functions are things like strings, numbers, arrays, etc. They are things the computer knows about and does something with.


myRandomFunction = sayMyClass;
  
//This puts the function itself into a named variable.

myRandomFunction()
    //returns: Code102

    //Calls the function
